Participants: Cheoljun Park, Kimin Kim, Jinheung Kim.

Goal: Bias reduction, Flat reduction.

Tried: Do median-combining bias files and reduct files with combined bias file.

Results & Problems: For Filter SLY47, bias reduction is ok. But bias binning has different from flat,object files
so those couldn't reduct with bias files of 550 filter.
Failed overscan subtration because of no ovsub parameter file.
We don't know why this file does not exist in focasred package.

Future Work: Data reduction with pyraf(not iraf).
